      Our goal is to provide high-quality listings of luxury residences in New York City.
      In NYC, we are constantly plagued by inconsistent real estate brokers,
      listings with missing information, and misleading information about
      listings, usually with pictures that make places seem bigger than they
      actually are, or vague descriptions and exaggerations of features of
      properties.

      Streeteasy is the most widely used rental finding platform in NYC, but
      there are lots of missing parts, for example, reviews, a one-click
      application process, faster claiming of properties via a system online,
      and an online scheduling system such as Calendly for setting up
      appointments. As Streeteasy is essentially a monopoly, they don't have a
      lot of motivation to change their platform too drastically if it is not
      needed.

      Our goal is to provide a platform that gives high quality and complete
      listings, with comprehensive information, to make finding an apartment so
      much easier and give confidence to the buyer.
